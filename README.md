## 1. Abstract

**MathMind-ScorePrediction** is an end-to-end, modular machine learning application that predicts student's math scores. It includes:  
- Modular programmatic pipeline (ingestion â†’ preprocessing â†’ training â†’ evaluation â†’ prediction)  
- Serialized artifacts: `preprocessor.pkl` and `model.pkl` for reliable deployment  
- A responsive, mobile-friendly frontend (HTML/CSS with Gemini CLI enhancements)  
- Flask backend for serving predictions  
- Dockerized deployment, available via **AWS ECR** (for production) and **Docker Hub** (for public access)  
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## 2. Introduction

Predicting student performance can inform educational interventions. The MathMind-ScorePrediction pipeline applies machine learning to student data, wrapped in a clean UI and deployed to the cloud for real-world usability and maintainability.

---

## 3. Objectives

- Achieve **â‰¥ 85% RÂ² score** (achieved 88%)  
- Build with **modular architecture** for scalability and maintainability  
- Serialize both **preprocessor** and **model** as `.pkl` artifacts  
- Provide a **responsive frontend UI**  
- Enable secure deployment via **AWS EC2 & ECR**, plus public access via **Docker Hub**  
- Automate deployments using **GitHub Actions CI/CD**

---

## 4. System Architecture

The system is structured for **portability, scalability, and automation**, combining:

1. **Frontend Layer** â€“ Responsive HTML/CSS interface  
2. **Backend Layer** â€“ Flask API integrating `preprocessor.pkl` and `model.pkl`  
3. **ML Pipeline** â€“ Modular ingestion, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction  
4. **Infrastructure Layer** â€“ Docker, AWS ECR, EC2, and Docker Hub distribution


---

### Workflow Summary

- **User Interaction**: Provides input via frontend  
- **Backend Processing**: Transforms input with `preprocessor.pkl`, infers via `model.pkl`, returns prediction  
- **Deployment Workflow**: Packaged as a single Docker image and managed across environments

---

### Why Docker?

The Dockerized image encapsulates all componentsâ€”code, pickled artifacts, and dependenciesâ€”ensuring consistent behavior, rapid deployment, and easy version control.


---

### AWS & Docker Hub

- **AWS ECR**: Private container registry for EC2 deployment  
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the running container in production (pulls from ECR)  
- **Docker Hub**: Public registry for users to pull and run the app using:

```

docker pull alisameed/mathmind-scoreprediction

## 6. Methodology

### 6.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing

* Source: Student Performance Indicator dataset
* Steps: Imputation â†’ Encoding â†’ Scaling â†’ Train/Test split
* Output: `preprocessor.pkl` for live inference

---

### 6.2 Model Training & Evaluation

* Evaluated models: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Linear Regression
* Best result: **CatBoost Regressor** with an RÂ² score of **88%**
* Output: `model.pkl` for deployment

---

### 6.3 Frontend Development

* Built with HTML5 + CSS3
* Styled via Gemini CLI for modern, minimalistic UI
* Pages include onboarding, form submission

![Frontend UI](.github/images/MathMind%20ScorePrediction%20HomePage.png)

---

### 6.4 Backend Development

* Flask-based API (`app.py`)
* Works with both pickled artifacts (`preprocessor.pkl`, `model.pkl`)
* Clean separation of modules in the pipeline for maintainability

---

## 7. Deployment Pipeline

### 7.1 Dockerization

* **Dockerfile** builds the complete image including app, models, and static assets
* `.dockerignore` is used to limit image size by excluding unnecessary files

---

### 7.2 AWS ECR & EC2

* ECR stores the Docker image securely
* EC2 pulls the latest image to deploy the app in production

---

### 7.3 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Deployment flow:

1. Code pushed to `main` triggers build
2. Docker image is built
3. Pushed to **AWS ECR**
4. EC2 instance pulls and redeploys via GitHub Actions

---

### 7.4 Docker Hub Distribution

The Docker image is publicly available at:

* Command:

  ```bash
  docker pull alisameed/mathmind-scoreprediction
  ```
* Docker Hub: [alisameed/mathmind-scoreprediction](https://hub.docker.com/r/alisameed/mathmind-scoreprediction)

---

## 8. Results

* **88% RÂ² score** from the CatBoost model
* Fully modular pipeline with reusable `preprocessor.pkl` & `model.pkl`
* Responsive frontend and scalable backend architecture
* Deployed on AWS EC2 with both ECR and public Docker Hub availability
